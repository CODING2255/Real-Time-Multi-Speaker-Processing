Backend Pipeline: Step-by-Step
1. 🗣️ Transcription → Using Whisper (Local Model)
   🔧 What it does:
    Converts audio (spoken words) into text using OpenAI's Whisper model (running locally).

    🧠 Technology:
    openai-whisper: a general-purpose speech recognition model.
    You're using the "base" model loaded with:
    python
    Copy
    Edit
    model = whisper.load_model("base")

   ⚙️ Workflow:
   Audio (either uploaded or recorded) is passed as bytes.
   You write these bytes to a temporary audio file using Python’s NamedTemporaryFile.
   Whisper reads and transcribes the file:
   python
   Copy
   Edit
   result = model.transcribe(temp_audio.name)
   Returns a dictionary; you extract only the "text".
   
✅ Why it's powerful:
High accuracy, even with background noise or different accents.
Runs offline, which means zero cloud dependency = full privacy.

3. 📌 Summarization → Using Hugging Face Transformer
   🔧 What it does:
   Takes the full transcribed text and condenses it into a short summary that covers the main points.
   
   🧠 Technology:
   transformers library from Hugging Face
   Using the pre-trained model: "facebook/bart-large-cnn"
   python
   Copy
   Edit
   summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
   
   ⚙️ Workflow:
   Your transcription (possibly very long) is truncated to 1024 characters (model input limit).
   The model generates a summary:
   python
   Copy
   Edit
   summary_list = summarizer(text, max_length=150, min_length=30)
   
✅ Why it's useful:
Helps users quickly grasp key ideas without reading the whole transcript.
Excellent for long meetings, interviews, and podcasts.

3. 🗣️ Diarization → Simulated Speaker Labeling
   🔧 What it does:
   Separates the transcript into chunks, each assigned to a "Speaker" (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2).
   Simulates the concept of “who said what.”
   
   🧠 Technology:
   Pure Python logic — no ML model involved.
   In your simulate_speaker_diarization() function:
   python
   Copy
   Edit
   sentences = transcript.split(". ")
   
   ⚙️ Workflow:
   Splits the full transcript by sentence (naively using period + space).
   Alternates assigning sentences to Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 every 2 sentences:
   python
   Copy
   Edit
   if (i + 1) % 2 == 0:
       speaker = 2 if speaker == 1 else 1
   Outputs:
   python
   Copy
   Edit
   [("Speaker 1", "Sentence 1."), ("Speaker 1", "Sentence 2."), ("Speaker 2", "Sentence 3."), ...]
   
✅ Why it's used:
Fast and simple way to simulate diarization without complex setup.
Good for demos and MVPs where exact speaker identification isn’t critical.

⚠️ Limitations:
Doesn't actually analyze the audio for speaker changes.
Real speaker diarization would use models like pyannote.audio.

🔄 How These Stages Connect

Audio → passed to Whisper → you get transcript

Transcript → passed to Hugging Face model → you get summary

Transcript → passed to diarizer → you get "Speaker X" segments

All results are then rendered in the Streamlit UI.
